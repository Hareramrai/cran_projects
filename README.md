## Patterns of Development

I personally try to keep things simple and small as much as possible. I am a fan of DRY but don't like to go super dry.

Btw I am a good believer in the single responsibility principle & prefer to have a number of classes instead of having a giant single class.

## Deployment instructions

- `git push heroku master`
